# Introduction
Diabetes prediction is a binary classification problem, where the goal is to classify whether a patient has diabetes based on health metrics. We utilized the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, containing features such as blood pressure, glucose levels, and BMI, and applied both machine learning and deep learning methods to develop predictive models.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes attributes like age, BMI, insulin levels, and more. It has been preprocessed to handle missing values and scaled for better model performance.

# Requirements

## Hardware
1. Processor: Intel Core or AMD equivalent
2. RAM: 4 GB
3. OS: Windows 7 or above
## Software
1. Python 3 or above
2. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, TensorFlow, Keras

# Methodologies
The following models were implemented and evaluated:

1. Random Forest
2. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
3. Gradient Boosting
4. Deep Neural Networks (DNN)

# System Architecture
The project workflow includes data preprocessing, training, and evaluation phases. The architecture utilizes deep learning layers (input, hidden, output) and machine learning models for comparative performance analysis.

# Results
The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics. The DNN model achieved the highest accuracy, making it a preferred approach in the project.

# Future Enhancements
## Future work could involve:

1. Expanding the dataset to include additional biomarkers.
2. Applying advanced deep learning architectures like CNNs and RNNs.
3. Optimizing model performance through hyperparameter tuning.
